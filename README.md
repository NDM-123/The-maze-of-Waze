# The-maze-of-Waze
Practicing in building a navigation program


## Introduction with the Project
This project is the basic of a navigation software,every map can be encoded into graphs. and as we know every graph as nodes and edges.
So this Project has classes that create nodes and edges.
From those classes we created a DGraph that combine the two in a graph.
The next Step is Coding algorithmes such as: finding the shortest path from one spot to another,are two vertices are connected and more...
And the final step is to create a GUI for the user so he can work with the software without knowing how to program.

## The functionality of the program
Because its our first try practicing with a few data structures together as well as combining all the data and working with diffrent algorithems to create a good structure for a navigation software. 
The GUI is allowing the user the ability to interact with the software in a much more intuative way.

## Algorithms
The project hold the next algorithms:
1) The Dijkstra algorithms.(finding the "cheaper way from from node to another").
2)Is Connected - checking if two nodes are connected.
3)The salesman problem idea - finding the shortest way between a group fo nodes.
4)Retrieving the length of the shortest path between two nodes.

## GUI 
The GUI Has a few options that enables the user to find all kind of calculations in the graph.
The options that the GUI can do:
1)The GUI can Open a Saved graph file as long as the file is in the same serializable format.
2)The GUI can save graphs that were in created Create mode.
3)The GUI has i mentioned has a Create mode that you can create a new graph by pressing with your mouse on the GUI window,and every time you press on the GUI it will add a node as well as an edge that carries a value for that edge.
A bonus action in create mode is you can change the a dot by pessing on it and dragging it to a new location.
If you have a graph so you have a window item that allows you to perform actions on the graph using the Algorithms that i mentions earlier.

## Summary
Thanks for using our software we would like to have any kind of feedback so we can improve our project,and create the ultimative program for navigation.
